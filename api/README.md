# API Definitions

For communication between backend and client web app websockets are used.   

The API and communication flow with the client web app is described in the [websocket-asyncapi.yaml](./websocket-asyncapi.yaml). You can use the website [asyncapi](https://studio.asyncapi.com/) to visualize the api document (copy and paste it in).

A detailed overview of the gameloop and communication via websockets is also available in the [backend WIKI](https://gitlab.mi.hdm-stuttgart.de/quizzit/backend-server/-/wikis/home).

For more help and how-to,
[see the API WIKI](https://gitlab.mi.hdm-stuttgart.de/quizzit/backend-server/-/wikis/Updating-the-API).
